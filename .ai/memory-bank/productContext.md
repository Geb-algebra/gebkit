# Product Context

## Why GebKit Exists

GebKit was created to provide developers with a modern, visually appealing component library that offers both traditional flat UI designs and trendy neumorphic styles. The library aims to make it easy for developers to create beautiful, consistent interfaces without having to build components from scratch or manage complex styling systems.

## Problems GebKit Solves

1. **Design Consistency**: Helps maintain visual consistency across applications
2. **Development Speed**: Reduces the time needed to implement common UI elements
3. **Design Trends**: Makes it easy to adopt modern design trends like neumorphism
4. **Component Complexity**: Handles complex UI behavior (like accessible dropdowns) so developers don't have to
5. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensures components work consistently across browsers

## How GebKit Works

GebKit is built with React and Tailwind CSS. It uses:
- Radix UI primitives for accessible, unstyled component foundations
- Tailwind CSS for styling with a utility-first approach
- Custom CSS utilities for specialized effects (particularly for neumorphic designs)
- TypeScript for type safety
- React Router for the demo website navigation

Components are organized by design style (flat or neumorphic) and share common patterns:
- Consistent prop interfaces
- Composition-based design (using React children)
- Accessibility features built-in

## User Experience Goals
