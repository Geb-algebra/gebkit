# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus of the GebKit project is on expanding the neumorphic component library to match the flat component library in terms of feature completeness. Recent efforts have been directed toward implementing neumorphic versions of:

1. Select component
2. Input component
3. Textarea component

These components have been successfully implemented with neumorphic styling that follows the established design patterns.

## Recent Changes

1. **Neumorphic Select Component**:
   - Created a styled version of the select component using the shadow-neumorphic-hole utility
   - Added appropriate focus and hover states with shadow transitions
   - Ensured proper accessibility and keyboard navigation

2. **Neumorphic Input Component**:
   - Implemented a neumorphic version with inset shadow effects
   - Added focus styles that simulate a pressed state
   - Preserved all the functionality of the original flat input

3. **Neumorphic Textarea Component**:
   - Created with consistent styling to match other text entry components
   - Applied appropriate neumorphic shadows for the inset effect
   - Added focus states with proper feedback

## Next Steps

1. **Component Coverage**:
   - Implement remaining components in the neumorphic style (checkbox, radio buttons, etc.)
   - Ensure all components have proper states (hover, focus, disabled, etc.)

2. **Documentation**:
   - Improve component documentation with usage examples
   - Document theming capabilities and customization options

3. **Accessibility Audit**:
   - Review all components for accessibility compliance
   - Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Review component rendering performance
   - Optimize CSS for better runtime performance

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Styling Approach**:
   - Using custom Tailwind utilities for neumorphic effects
   - Consistent styling patterns across all components

2. **Component API Consistency**:
   - Maintaining identical APIs between flat and neumorphic components
   - Using composition patterns for complex components

3. **Shadow Effects**:
   - Using a combination of inset and outset shadows for neumorphic effects
   - Different shadow utilities for different states (hole, button, pressed)
