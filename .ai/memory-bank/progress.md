# Progress

## What Works

### Flat Components
- ✅ Button (with variants: default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link)
- ✅ Input (with various input types)
- ✅ Textarea
- ✅ Select (with groups, labels, and items)
- ✅ Navigation Menu
- ✅ Switch
- ✅ Card (with header, content, footer components)

### Neumorphic Components

- ✅ Switch
- ✅ Card (with header, content, footer components)

### Demo Website
- ✅ Component showcase pages
- ✅ Navigation between flat and neumorphic styles
- ✅ Syntax highlighting for code examples
- ✅ Dark/light mode toggle

## Current Status

The project has made solid progress with the implementation of core components in both flat and neumorphic styles. The most recent additions are the neumorphic versions of:
- Select component
- Input component
- Textarea component

These match the functionality of their flat counterparts but with neumorphic styling.

## Known Issues

1. **Mobile Responsiveness**:
   - Some component demos may not be fully optimized for small screens

2. **Theming Flexibility**:
   - Current theming relies heavily on CSS variables
   - May need more flexible theming options for component-level customization

3. **Component Feature Parity**:
   - Need to ensure all variants and states are consistently implemented across both design styles

4. **Testing Coverage**:
   - Need comprehensive testing for accessibility compliance
   - Need cross-browser testing for all components
