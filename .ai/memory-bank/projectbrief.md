# GebKit

## Project Overview

GebKit is a React component library with a demo website that showcases how these components work. The library includes both flat and neumorphic design styles for UI components, providing developers with a range of modern, visually appealing options for their applications.

## Core Requirements and Goals

1. **Dual Design Systems**: Provide both flat and neumorphic design variants of all components
2. **Modern UI Components**: Deliver a comprehensive set of standard UI elements
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure all components follow accessibility best practices
4. **Showcase Website**: Maintain a demo site that allows developers to see components in action
5. **Consistent API**: Maintain consistent component APIs across all design variants
6. **Responsive Design**: Ensure all components work well across different device sizes
7. **Type Safety**: Utilize TypeScript for type-safe component props

## Project Scope

The component library includes standard UI elements such as:
- Buttons
- Inputs
- Textareas
- Select dropdowns
- Switches
- Cards
- Navigation menus

The library uses Tailwind CSS for styling components, with custom utility classes for neumorphic effects.
